					<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
					<p>
						This is a class project for ITP 310: Design for User Experience. 
						<br><br>
						"Kardon - Sonoma" is a UX Design for a hotel mobile application. My professor gave me the opportunity to design a mobile app 
						in Figma for an existing or non-existent hotel.

						<h2>Research Results</h2>
						<p>
							As a result from the interviews, it seems like <a style="color:#474000;font-weight: bold;">there's interest in a modern style hotel with an established name. </a> 
							Sonoma is a great location since it's a mini-vacation of sorts with a lot of character and notoriety. 
							Lois & Henry are interested in extending their trips to spend more quality time with their loved ones. 
							Arthur is interested in the idea of a quick trip, and Sonoma's proximity entices him. However, he wants 
							more than just a wine trip so the hotel should include something for all audiences. Henry didn't seem to 
							even think of Sonoma as an overnight destination, so an established hotel brand could validate Sonoma as a 
							weekend trip destination rather than just a day trip destination.

					<!-- Reflection -->
					<br><br><br><br><br>
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						Users download hotel mobile applications for a variety of reasons. They could be browsing their amenities, 
						booking a room, or trying to earn rewards. I didn't really get a chance to figure that out over the course 
						of this assignment, and I wish I did.
					</p>
					<p>
						I think it would've really changed the whole layout of the application. I could have focused on highlighting 
						the rewards more on the home page (rather than just on the profile page), or I could have included booking 
						functionality in one of the frames. Nevertheless, I think I may have found an intersection of all those things 
						with this design.
					</p>
					<p>
						In this project, I took some creative liberties to utilize some of the unfamiliar design tools in Figma. I may
						 have over-used gradients and prototyping overlays (out of excitement). I wanted to expand my skills with this 
						 tool that's still fresh to me, so can you blame me?
					</p>
					<p>
						This application is far from perfect, and I learned a lot through the revision process. I've found that I 
						really enjoy talking to others about my work. I see critiques from users as an opportunity to better my work 
						and my ability to learn from others. If I could have talked to 1000 people about this project, then I think I 
						would have one of the best hotel apps ever! I can't wait to continue talking to users and developing my design 
						skills every chance I get.
