					<!-- PROBLEM SPACE -->
					<h2>Context & Problem Space</h2>
					<p>Struct Club is a creator platform for fitness instructors to create music-inspired classes.<span style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">
						"Edit Mode" is a set of views that allows users to add moves (i.e. Squats) to songs from Spotify.</span>
						After 30 qualitative user interviews, our team found that users were creating very long classes: 30-50+ minutes.

								<h2>
									Users told us the editing process was taking OVER an hour.
								</h2>
								<div class="project-desc">
									<p>For a 30-40 min class, the average user spent around an hour creating an entire workout.
									This results from the process of adding selecting a playlist, adding time cues, and choosing a workout.
									Many also users pointed out that that there were too many steps to edit an individual moves.
									User's wanted to create more classes, faster (but also wanted maintain the accuracy our
									editing process). The solution needed to achieve several goals:
									<ul>
										<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Reduce the overall time spent creating a class</li>
										<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Reduce the number of steps to edit a single move</li>
										<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Maintain accuracy in editing process (in seconds)</li>

					<!-- RESEARCH -->
					<br><br><br><br><br>
					<h2>Research & Solution Formation</h2>
					<p>The first step is always research. First, I took a look at similar applications that utilize a timeline editng view and 
						segments which require extra attention (iMovie, Google Calendar, and the Photos application). After evaluating each app, 
						<span style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">
						I asked myself: "how did this app provide a solution to my problem and how can I improve upon it to server my users?"
						</span>

								<h2>
									Not many available solutions
								</h2>
								<div class="project-desc">
									<p>
										Each application presented options for my solution. At first glance, I found that iMovie followed very 
										similar conventions to Struct Club. It utilized a scrollable timeline and presented options at the bottom
										of the screen selected segments. However, <a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">iMovie's edit mode had the same pitfalls of Struct Club. The edit 
										process was arduous and I estimated about 8 taps per segment I edited. Google Calendar events (or segments)
										also required about 6-7 taps per event to change dates, times, recurrences, and color coding.</a> Although, it 
										required less overall time (likely resulting from the nature of events -> they don't happen all at once).
									</p>
								</div>
								<h2>
									Formulating a new solution
								</h2>
								<div class="project-desc">
									<p>
										In turn, I had to turn to unconvential sources like Spotify and Apple Music for inspiration. I took a song overlay from Apple Music 
										(like the one on the left) and deconstructed its elements. It contained an icon/album cover, title, important information, 
										and buttons to navigate to and from the next item. In many ways, a song overlay could be classified as a song "card." The card has 
										key advantages:
										<ul>
											<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Contains only the most important information & buttons for the segment</li>
											<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Hides all unnecessay functionality below it</li>
											<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Allows for quick navigation between segments (or songs)</li>
										</ul>

					<!-- WIREFRAMING -->
					<br><br><br><br><br>
					<h2>Wireframing & Prototyping</h2>
					<p>
						The first step of Wireframing (in my design process) is sketching on paper. Then I meet with stakeholders (i.e. my lovely CEO, Amira, and amazing engineer, Eann)
						to consider business strategy, resource constraints, and feasibility. Next, I begin drafting wireframes & the iteration process follows for the next few weeks.  
						Ultimately, <a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">the process completes once all stakeholders feel the design (1) achieves our users' goals and (2) aligns
							 with our overall strategy.</a> Especially in a start-up, it's also important to consider what SMALL changes will have a BIG impact (80% results 20% effort).

								<h2>Where do I start?</h2>
								<div class="project-desc">
									<p>
										First, let's take a look at <a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">the previous version of Edit Mode</a>. 
										There are several visual elements & functionality that need to be addressed to solve our problem. 
										
										<ul>
											<li><a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Timeline:</a> Users can horizontally scroll across a timeline to view their entire workout.</li>
											<li><a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Segment:</a> A segment represents a workout move (i.e. Jumping Jacks) with an intensity (indicated by the color).</li>
											<li><a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Mark:</a> A mark is a draggable element which represents the end/beginning of a new segment.</li>
											<li><a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Song:</a> Helps users visually see their location within the song.</li>
											<li><a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Music Controller:</a> All workouts are companied with curlated playlists from users.</li>
											<li><a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Add Mark:</a> Users typically listen through playlists & add marks at points of musical transition. 
												This is key to creating fantastic music-inspired workouts.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="col-md-5">
						<h2>Sketches</h2>
						<p>
							Just to reiterate: users told us that the editing process took too long (over 1 hour). So the <a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">solution</a> needed to achieve several goals... 
							<ul>
								<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Reduce the overall time spent creating a class</li>
								<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Reduce the number of steps to edit a single move</li>
								<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Maintain accuracy to the second</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							My solution draws inspiration from Apple Music song overlays (or "cards"). The <a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">cards</a> have key advantages that could help streamline the edit process...  
							<ul>
								<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Contains only the most important information & buttons for the segment</li>
								<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Hides all unnecessay functionality below it</li>
								<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Allows for quick navigation between segments (or songs)</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							On the right, I outline some of my ideas for "cards" of segments. The card basline sketches depict how a user would navigate from card to card. 
							The card arrangement demonstrates how the data of a segment would be displayed on a card. <a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">
								The highlighted blue indicates the chosen design by stakeholders. </a>

								<h2>Drafts</h2>
								<div class="project-desc">
									<p>
										After producing low fidelity wireframes, <a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">I moved onto mid-to-high fidelity wireframing in Figma.</a> I produced a number of draft 
										frames, but these are the highlights! At every step in the design process, it's important to reevaluate whether or not the 
										solutions create value for users. Sometimes, I can walk myself into the "wouldn't it be cool if" conversation without considering 
										my users' goals. 
									</p>
									<p>
										How do cards help users achieve their goals? 
										<ul>
											<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Reduces the number of steps to edit a SINGLE segment from 8 to 5 (no navigation to new screen)</li>
											<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Reduces the number of steps to navigate to a NEW segment from 3 to 1 (left & right arrows)</li>
											<li style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Maintains editing accuracy to the second (timeline intact)</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>
										Now that the design aligns with user goals, I met with stakeholders to determine which iteration would present the best image to 
										our users. SPOILER: The chosen design has sparkles around it!

						<h2>Final Version</h2>
						<p>
							The final version of the my design...
						</p>
						<p>
							Now users can happily create workouts with ease. Navigating quickly from one segment to another, user will 
							be able to spend more time curating workouts and less time hassling between views. The edit process for a single 
							segment also now requires 3 less steps, so users will spend even less time per segment. 
						</p>
						<h2>Number of steps decreased from 11 to 6...</h2>
						<p style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">
							The final version presents an elegant visual hierarchy, aligns with the Struct Club's design system, and helps users achieve their goals.

					<!-- REFLECTION-->
					<br><br><br><br><br>
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>				
								
						Edit Mode Cards tested my design skills more than any other project that summer. I struggled not only in juggling other projects in Marketing and Quality Assurance, but 
						also in developing my own processes as a ONE-PERSON UX team. I had to learn quickly and develop standards for my work which didn't exist. I guess that's 
						the beauty of start-ups. I also felt some pressure to not skrew everything up! Edit Mode is a core feature set for Struct Club.
						In then end, I can confidently say I've learned a lot about myself and developing design processes:
						<ul>
							<li><a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Start out with simple sketches before wireframes:</a> I fell into the trap of starting with high-fidelity, 
								and I ended up creating a lot of work for myself. I spent too much time trying to make everything pixel perfect when I wasn't even sure it was the solution.
							</li>
							<li><a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Don't spend so much time prototyping everything for drafts:</a> This is another time-saving tip. I spent waaay too
								much time creating fancy animations in Figma. Part of me really enjoyed working with the tool, but it ended up costing me stress closer to the deadline.
							</li>
							<li><a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Take extensive notes & ask tons of questions in stakeholder meetings:</a> Stakeholders have many of strong opinions 
								(especially when your stakeholder is the CEO). Their time is also very limited. In initial meetings, I found myself taking her opinions at face value and then 
								not quite reaching her expectations. Non-designers do no speak in design terms, so it's imperative that you get a clear understanding for their suggestions.  
							</li>
							<li><a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Believe in your ideas and avoid impostor syndrome:</a> A common pitfall, especially in young designers, is to doubt 
								your own ideas. Early in the project, impostor syndrome affected my ability to present confidently and demonstrate my skills to my boss. I learned to deal with it 
								by reaching out to the extremely supportive design community. Learning about others' experiences helped me remove my ego from my designs and become a better 
								listener. 
							</li>

									I wish I had time to...
								</h2>
								<div class="project-desc">
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Validate my design:</a> I wish I had time to test my assumptions. This
												project came at the second half of my internship, so I did not get a chance to see if my assumptions were true.
											</li>
											<li><a style="color:#4F2A8D;font-weight: bold;">Be a part of the development:</a> I wish I had time to develop my designs in Swift.
												It's a super gratifying feeling to bring your creations to "life!" Best of luck to my colleague!
